I have used the AI as a search engine and as query website where it helps me to understand the shortcomings of my code and
through this I can learn how to code in a more professional way and understanding the code in different perspectives. 
The part of design was especially helpful, since I could use a template that he provided and I could do my little adjustments
to make it fit my style. 
Overall, I would say that through the help of AI, I could code in a more efficient way and understand more the code which I 
wouldnt have been able without the usage of it.
